    The Computer Vision researchers in the Department are work on visual functionalities that induce semantically meaningful interpretations of the visual world. The focus is on developing a clear understanding of the computational and engineering related
    issues underlying the perception, planning, and control mechanisms. In computer vision, the faculty members along with the post-graduate and undergraduate students aspire to build intelligent visual algorithms covering various areas such as image
    and video editing, medical image analysis, object class recognition, stereo vision, and visual cryptography.
