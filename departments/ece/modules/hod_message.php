				<p class="card-text">The Department of Electronics and Communication
					Engineering came into existence at the Jaipur
					Engineering College & Research Center in 2000, by
					the approval of All India Council for Technical
					Education (AICTE), to meet the growing requirement
					of practical design engineers in the country and
					abroad. The greatest asset of the department is its
					highlyaa motivated and learned faculty. The available
					diversity of expertise of the faculty with the support
					of the other technical staff prepares the students to
					work in the global multicultural environment. The
					department not only aims to make our students
					technically sound and knowledgeable but also to
					nurture their wisdom and make them a better and
					responsible human being. The graduates of the
					Electronics & Communication Stream have been
					selected by some of the worldâ€™s leading corporations
					& as well as by most of the leading Indian
					counterparts.We hope that we will continue to
					deliver our best to serve the society and mankind. It
					is also expected that our students will continue to
					pass on the skills which they have developed during
					their stay at this department to the whole of the world
					for a better society.
