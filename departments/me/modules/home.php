            Department have 13 well equipped laboratories. A separate CENTRE OF EXALLENECE has been established which give the opportunity to the students to work on the software’s such as SOLID WORKS, ANSYS, COMSOL, Pro-ENGINEER, AutoCAD, MATLAB etc. A wide selection of projects, seminars and training facilities besides technical visits to industrial enterprises and specialized lectures from industry specialists generates enormous potential and confidence among the students enabling them to independently handle the life size problems in their engineering careers. Many MoU’s are signed with various industries offering opportunity to the students to learn working culture of industry. The Department also has a well-established workshop for training in Smithy, Carpentry, Welding, Fitting and Machine tools.

        <div class="sectionContent card-body">
          The area of Computer Science and Engineering deals with not only Theory of Computation and Design of Computational Systems, but also new engineering trends in software and hardware technology. A good technologist with this specialization is expected to
          possess excellent analytical ability, mathematical aptitude, problem solving skills and a logical mind. The Computer Science and Engineering Department at JSS is affiliated to Uttar Pradesh Technical University, Lucknow and endeavours to provide
          an environment where students can grow into Computer Engineers of tomorrow possessing all these necessary attributes. Academic standards are high and students have an opportunity to learn from experienced and well-qualified faculty members.
          The classroom sessions are reinforced through practical sessions, projects, workshops and many other co-curricular activities. Industrial interaction is promoted through various MOUs with companies like IBM, SAP and Nokia resulting in increased
          employability of students.
