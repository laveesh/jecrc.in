								First of all i would like to thank Arpit Sir, you and all the JECRC family for considering me capable enough for such a prestigious award. My name is Vipul Saini. I'm from Jaipur Rajasthan I did my B Tech. from JECRC (2010 Batch Mechanical) Presently I'm posted as Assistant Commandant (DySP) at Bangalore Airport and working for MHA. Before this i was posted at Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre, Trivandrum- Department of Space. During my college days i got a chance to represent JECRC in Bodybuilding and Power lifting at National Level and won awards at BOSM (BITS Open Sports Meet) MST (MNIT Sports Meet) and various other events. The most interesting thing about studying in JECRC and i think everyone must agree is that it provides you freedom to express yourself unlike other colleges where you don't get such liberty. I got Campus placed in Surya Roshni Ltd in 2010. That was an year of recession and getting campus placed was a privilege in itself. I was fortunate though that my joining was the earliest in our batch. There I worked as a Production Engineer and was posted at Anjar near Bhuj (Gujarat). There I felt a need to broaden my horizon and become a Civil Servant (Since my Elder brother is already RAS). So I resigned from my job in 2011 and went Delhi to prepare for Civil Services after working for an year. I prepared from Delhi for 2 yrs and got selected through UPSC in 2013. Got trained in 2014 from Police Academy in Hyderabad. Thereafter I did Commando Course twice, once Short Commando and second time Special Task Force Commando, Basic Fire Safety Course, Special Tactics Course and various other courses in such a short span of 4 yrs. Of my major Security Assignments till date I was in Madras High Court during the time of agitation of Lawyers, part of Defence Expo (GOA), Security Expo (Delhi), Aero Show (Bangalore), etc

								I have completed my graduation in 2008. Initially I joined in I.T branch but during first year found my interest in Mechanical and shifted to it after completing first year. Those four years (2004-2008) were undoubtedly the best years of my life. Great teachers, friends & memories are assets that I gained in that period which have made me a rich person, not by virtue of money but by emotions and relationships. M.P.Singh Sir, Manish Jain Sir and Kuldeep sir are people whom I owe a lot in my life. 
								I joined Reliance Industries limited as a Maintenance Engineer in 2008 and had worked there till 2010, then went on for pursuing my MBA from Delhi Technological University (Popularly known as Delhi College of Engineering).Since 2012, I am working with Tata Hitachi Construction Machinery Company Private limited as Sr. Manager-Sales & Marketing in Jaipur.
								Sitting in my office while writing this note pictures of College campus, Yadav ji ki canteen, Mechanical labs & old friends are floating in my mind, I am feeling nostalgic. I am having a feeling of Gratitude towards the Institute for allowing me to be a part of it.
