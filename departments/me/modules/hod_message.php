								The Mechanical Engineering Department intends to provide practical industry based technical and professional education to the students. Mechanical engineers use the principles of energy, materials and mechanics to design and manufacture machines and devices of all types. They create the process and systems that drive technology and industry. The faculty aims at putting extra ordinary effort towards motivating the students in solving actual industrial problems by undertaking various projects, industrial visits and in-plant training. The Department is actively associated in grooming the engineering graduates in Mechanical Engineering by nurturing them with inputs from various basic and specialized subjects including Production, Industrial, Thermal and Design Engineering. A wide selection of projects, seminars and training facilities besides technical visits to industrial enterprises and specialized lectures from industry specialists generates enormous potential and confidence among the students enabling them to independently handle the life size problems in their engineering careers. The faculty members of the department have organized national and international conferences, The Department has well equipped laboratories for the graduate students. Some of these laboratories are Strength of Materials Lab, Material Science Lab, Kinematics/ Dynamics of Machines Lab, Heat Transfer Lab,Production Lab, Thermal Lab, Fluid Mechanics Lab, Fluid Machines Lab, CAD/CAM Lab, etc.
