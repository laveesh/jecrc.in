						First of all, I would like to thank Arpit Sir, you and all the JECRC family for considering me capable enough for such a prestigious award. My name is Vipul Saini. I'm from Jaipur Rajasthan I did my B Tech. from JECRC (2010 Batch Mechanical) Presently I'm posted as Assistant Commandant (DySP) at Bangalore Airport and working for MHA. Before this, I was posted at Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre, Trivandrum- Department of Space. During my college days, I got a chance to represent JECRC in Bodybuilding and Powerlifting at National Level and won awards at BOSM (BITS Open Sports Meet) MST (MNIT Sports Meet) and various other events. The most interesting thing about studying in JECRC and I think everyone must agree is that it provides you the freedom to express yourself, unlike other colleges where you don't get such liberty. I got Campus placed in Surya Roshni Ltd in 2010. That was a year of recession and getting campus placed was a privilege in itself. I was fortunate though that my joining was the earliest in our batch. There I worked as a Production Engineer and was posted at Anjar near Bhuj (Gujarat). There I felt a need to broaden my horizon and become a Civil Servant (Since my Elder brother is already RAS). So I resigned from my job in 2011 and went to Delhi to prepare for Civil Services after working for a year. I prepared from Delhi for 2 yrs and got selected through UPSC in 2013. Got trained in 2014 from Police Academy in Hyderabad. Thereafter I did Commando Course twice, once Short Commando and second time Special Task Force Commando, Basic Fire Safety Course, Special Tactics Course and various other courses in such a short span of 4 yrs. Of my major Security Assignments till date I was in Madras High Court during the time of agitation of Lawyers, part of Defence Expo (GOA), Security Expo (Delhi), Aero Show (Bangalore), etc.

						<p>Completed Bachelor degree in mechanical engineering from JECRC in the year 2007. I did it in honors’ never thought I will be achieving that with so many activities during those 4 years. I was also the founder of Yuva, an NGO. You can learn more about Yuva at www.planetyuva.com. I was also selected during college placement at Reliance Communication as a Graduate Engineer. However, I didn’t work out as my expectation for myself was a bit high towards the vision of life. I had already prepared for GRE during my college days. Yuva mechanical engineering, GRE and college life, was a passion for me. I never had a moment where I felt like it’s a burden on me. Even during university, I enjoyed studying with hostel roommates. I also stayed In the hostel for 4 years. Indeed, even in hostel leadership worked. We improved food menu. It was all decided by every member of 1 st year,2 and year,3 rd year and 4 the year. We did celebrate all the functions. I had very good bonding with my batch mates teachers and all juniors/seniors. My seniors shaped me a lot. They had their own charm I learned a lot from them. Everyone motivated me to publish my own book name as “Journey of life” in professors I wouldn’t have achieved all this and they are M.P Singh sir, Ravi Sir, and Manish Sir. Also, I had big support from Director sir. Sometimes I had long conversations with him regarding Yuva. He always uplifted me. JECRC is a perfect mix where one can groom himself/herself in all way.</p>
						<p>Then I moved to Detroit for my Master Degree in Industrial engineering at Detroit in 2008. I don’t know why I loved industrial Engineering but it was awesome. I had always desired from inside to learn new things.US Style is different from India. Every work, they teach you to give exam present case study, solve problem and presentation. Their way of teaching is so intense that you must focus every week and get it done. Every week decides your final grade. I almost completed 75% degree in 8 months. Then I moved to Chicago for my internship at Motorola. In meantime, there was one rule in my university, where you have to pay 9 credit fee for 1 year and that total to almost $10,000. This doesn’t count in your degree program. I wasn’t aware of it and this was extra. More than I felt like, this is wrong . I am not using any university resources than why should I pay the fee. I started asking questions of my adviser, dean and head college of engineering. It further went till university president. I also created awareness among student. Slowly it turned into a movement and finally university change the law in favor of students. Now student needs to pay 3 credit fee and that too count in the degree program. After that, I focused on my internship. During my internship, I was credited as six sigma black belt from ASQ. Later I joined Motorola as full time. The black belt was the biggest achievement for me as I was too young for that.</p>					</div>

					I have completed my graduation in 2008. Initially, I joined in the I.T branch but during the first year found my interest in Mechanical and shifted to it after completing the first year. Those four years (2004-2008) were undoubtedly the best years of my life. Great teachers, friends & memories are assets that I gained in that period which have made me a rich person, not by virtue of money but by emotions and relationships. M.P.Singh Sir, Manish Jain Sir and Kuldeep sir are people whom I owe a lot in my life. I joined Reliance Industries limited as a Maintenance Engineer in 2008 and had worked there till 2010, then went on for pursuing my MBA from Delhi Technological University (Popularly known as Delhi College of Engineering). Since 2012, I am working with Tata Hitachi Construction Machinery Company Private limited as Sr. Manager-Sales & Marketing in Jaipur. Sitting in my office while writing this note pictures of College campus, Yadav Ji ki canteen, Mechanical labs & old friends are floating in my mind, I am feeling nostalgic. I am having a feeling of Gratitude towards the Institute for allowing me to be a part of it.
