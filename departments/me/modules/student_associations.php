					In this race of just coming first and not grasping any knowledge, Xananoids took its initial step in inculcating the knowledge among the students of the first year with the basic of robotics. The seminar took place in three sessions. It was great to see such overwhelming enthusiasm of the young buds. We wish that this zeal and curiosity learn more and more stays forever.
