  <div class="sectionContent card-body px-4">
    <p>A challenge in engineering computational technology is the simulation of multiphasic applications where different physical phenomena are involved such as fluid-structure â€“thermal interactions. A simulation strategy is to solve each part with an existing software package and to couple both processes by a data interface between the software codes. The advantage of using existing software packages is that one can benefit from their advanced features.</p>
