We started the institution with three branches namely, Computer Science Engineering, Electrical Engineering and Electronics and Communication Engineering. At that time we had 180 students. The very next year we introduced Information and Technology. After the introduction of the new branch we had a total of 240 students. In 2003, we introduced another branch i.e. Mechanical. After this new branch, the students increased by 60. By 2008, we started taking TFWS seats. A total of 42 students enrolled for the TFWS seats. In 2009, we came up with yet another branch, Civil Engineering. With this new advancement, the students shot up to 480.
