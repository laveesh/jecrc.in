			IT industry is one of the fastest growing fields in INDIA. People from other departments are also attracted to this sparkling career genre which has produced a glut of magnificent opportunities for aspiring technicians. <br>
Over the years, IT Department of JECRC has indulged in many ventures. OSD(Organization of Student Developers) group is an establishment that mainly focuses on learning nuances of web design and development through self learning. PAC(Programming and Algorithm Club) under the mentorship of Himanshu Dixit has been working vigorously to develop competitive programming skills in students, so as to help students participate in different coding contests and ace them. <br>
The importance of artificial intelligence is already known to the world. The advent of deep learning has created a buzz amongst aspiring engineers. To tackle this challenge, the department has constituted JAI(JECRC-Artificial Intelligence). <br>
Several faculties in non-IT department work in areas closely related to Computer Science.  They conduct courses in their own department at the intersection of IT and other department. Our department have active courses in cryptography, information theory, computer vision, machine learning, computer architecture etc. These electives could be taken up as Department Electives or ALCs (Additional Learning Courses). <br>
These are exciting opportunities in the world of open source – a chance to get to work on a real-world codebase with excellent developers from across the hile it’s always better to apply to dedicated internship programs, you could directly email suitable university professors or company recruiters, seeking an internship. There is a very specific way to do this, do not spam. The best strategy is to first work with a professor in the institute and gain some research experience in some area of information technology. Then, contact professors who know your college advisor or whose work is closely aligned to your advisor’s. If you have built a good rapport with your advisor, feel free to take his / her advice about this world. <br>
Our motive to provide the students with the best opportunities has been exemplary, and our zeal to hand the students with an unprecedented amount of success is something that drives us to work and achieve more.
