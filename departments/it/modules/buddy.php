	<p class="sectionContent pt-4" >The successful alumni of our department always contribute towards the development of the new budding engineers in each and every way possible. We have started a buddy system for the final year students in which each final year student has been assigned a mentor who is presently working in MNC and were graduated in between 2010-2017. A total of 66 mentors have been assigned to the students so far as the no of eligible students is 51. These mentors take interviews of their mentees once a week and give them feedback. Also, various alumni sessions are organised where alumni share their preparation strategies and solve queries of the students. In this way, the passouts help the current students so that they can also excel in their respective fields.
