					<p>
					The idea of gaining knowledge through specialized analysis of mass data started with data collection in the 1960s, and has steadily increased both in the amount of data processed and the sophistication of questions businesses try to answer. <br>

					Through this progression from static to dynamic and now to proactive provision of information, knowledge discovery through databases (KDD) still has the goal to extract useful intelligence from this data by using database and data management aspects like cluster analysis, classification or regression. <br>

					Early adopters of data mining were certain sectors that already had an affinity to data, such as the financial services industry and insurance companies. Retailers followed soon, using it for tracking inventory and various forms of customer relations management. Now utility companies use smart meters to predict energy consumption, and health care providers use RFID chips in name tags to track how often doctors wash their hands during rounds to help prevent the spreading of disease.

					<p>Hacking is an unorthodox way to solve problems, however, it is most often perceived negatively in the public. A hackathon is an event that gathers programmers with different skill sets to “hack”, or work collaboratively, on a software project. <br>

					IT Hackathon provides a platform for students to unleash their creativity and collaboration skills, two vital skills for future learning and career development, through coming up with ideas and building the product collaboratively. <br>

					Programming is the new literacy. Every industry, from ﬁnance to transportation, requires people who know how to program. By equipping students with development skills, more opportunities will open up for them in the future. <br>

					Developing culture encourages people to think out of the box. Students challenge themselves to create something new and to take ownership of what they create. These are important but often neglected experiences.

					Mahatma  Gandhi communicated  a  quintessential  message  to  the  nation  through  his  efforts  to educate people around him about cleanliness. To work seriously towards this vision of Gandhiji, Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi launched Swachh Bharat Abhiyan. One of the aspects of this mission is "Swachhta Pakhwada" which was initiated by AICTE in JECRC foundation <br>

					During Swachhta Pakhwada, IT Department conducted  "ELOCUTION DAY" to bring behavioural  and  attitudinal  change  among  the  students  through  innovative  activities  so  that  the ultimate goals of the "Swachh Bharat Abhiya A creative and collaborative platform was provided by the department to make the event a resounding success. <br>

					This platform brought together the collective thoughts of teachers aswell as students towards the mission with the help of their speeches. <br>

					Through the elocution, everyone learnt that this mission is not just about cleaning surroundings but also seeking the participation of people in planting trees, creating trash-free environment, providing sanitation facilities and then paving a way for "Swachh Bharat" eventually. <br>
