				<p class="card-text">The perpetual energy, movement and enthusiasm of the students permeate the atmosphere at JECRC. The Department of Information and Technology has recorded consistent improvement in its academic, research and placement performance. It offers a range of innovatively designed programs whose curricula are constantly updated to meet the changing requirement of the industry and also to meet the needs of major stakeholders. To accomplish these goals, we provide a coding environment and proper guidance so that synergies can be created in these areas, and our students can aspire to become job seekers to job creators. Our basic mission is to continue to do what we have always done; develop the students with integrity and values; also, to give our students the best opportunities and outcome based education. I believe that our students have been well accepted in their job profiles and have consistently exceeded expectations of the corporate world which can be seen as most of our alumni are studying and giving their best in various esteemed institutions worldwide. During study at the department, the students are encouraged to get hands-on experience in the corporate world through internship projects with reputed organizations. In their curriculum they are encouraged to take up mini projects to supplement theoretical knowledge with practical experience. They also undertake projects benefiting local industries or dealing with local problems. These projects enable them to understand the relevance of working in a group and also help them to realize the finer aspects and importance of teamwork. The curriculum is taught by distinguished faculty combining academic excellence and real world experience with dedication and commitment. We are encouraged to see many industries coming back to our Institution, which reinforces our suitability to the dynamic corporate world.
