    Computer Science and Information Technology faculty research interests in software engineering is principally in the area of Service Oriented Architecture, Orchestration and Choreography for composing of web services , Ontology , Aspect Oriented Software
    engineering, Metrics development, Defect Management, regression testing, reverse engineering and testing techniques. The aim is to develop and experiment with industry standard solutions using advanced software development techniques and understanding
    of how software systems evolve. Different software solutions are developed in order to satisfy given software requirements. Other work involves developing better models and techniques for the design and implementation of software systems. Some research
    work includes test prioritization techniques, design and development of testing techniques, repairing transformation of test cases for regression testing and developing software quality management models. This group tries to ensure better and consistent
    research results in software development practice.
