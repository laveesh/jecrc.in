  	<p>JECRC Alumni Association aims at connecting the JECRC Alumni with their Alma- Mater and present
students with a clear focus on mutual growth and development of the student community and Alumni
community simultaneously. The cell strives to <strong>strengthen the Alumni – Alumni, Alumni- Student, and
Alumni- Institute network</strong> all throughout the year by organizing activities and events that benefit all the
communities at large. It also strives to bring<strong> training, internship and placement opportunities </strong>for the
present students through the Alumni Community.</p>
<p>
JECRC is a hardcore believer of the fact that nothing grows in isolation, it is the team that prospers and
flourishes in the long run and hence, it becomes vital for the institutes to keep its legacy ambassadors –
The Alumni in a constant network with the institute and students.</p>
