    <p class="py-2">Alumni sessions are organised in the campus for the guidance of the students in higher education and to choose from various career options available out there. The mantra behind this activity is to provide the present students with the opportunity to learn from the experiences of their seniors and get the success codes from them. This also gives a chance for the students to get their questions answered from the ones they can most relate to.</p>
