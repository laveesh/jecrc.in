								Computer Science & Engineering Program works with efficiency and added strength in a manner which focuses on providing the best. With the continuous evolution in technology and computer science, the department marches hand in hand with this progress, never letting the knowledge offered to students lag behind under any circumstances.

								We nurture a student’s needs to stimulate and grow boundlessly, and offer an environment inducing mind’s capabilities to comprehend and infer. With regular training sessions, workshops, national and international conferences, CSE Department makes sure that the student’s get the best exposure, to develop their own selves.

								With this second edition of SCOOP, I congratulate the students to take this initiative further and bring our department’s activities to everyone’s notice. Guiding and assisting them has been a pleasure. You will find everything that goes on behind the computer screens of our wing, with a scoop of our magazine SCOOP.

								Best of luck to everyone!
