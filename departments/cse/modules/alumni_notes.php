				From the very first batch of JECRC, Nitendra Mathur was a powerful speaker and debater but was a casual chap in academics. He was not much clear about what he actually wanted to take up in future, he was one of those curious backbenchers but did not make his mind until his MBA, he sat for interviews just because he wanted to have a job on day zero so that he could be free from rest of the interviews, the only that made him win things was his unmatchable confidence, and his never say no attitude and today, he is working as <strong>VP-DBS Treasures</strong> offshore desk Head, Singapore.

				Be very clear in your goals. There should be only one goal at a time. The more clear you are about what you want, the more likely you are to achieve it. My only goal, dedication, hard work and disciplined life is all behind my success. <strong>IF NOT US THEN WHO, IF NOT NOW THEN WHEN...</strong> Everyone is a perfect piece of god

			"My dream of becoming an entrepreneur and running a business which is doing fairly well currently wouldn’t have been possible without the support of college. My faculty and mentors helped me in maintaining good academic record and learning about business at the same time. Sessions with flourished and upcoming entrepreneurs and extensive research guidance helped in getting an idea of real world and the competition."
