			"Along with building strong fundamentals in Computer Science, I also got hundreds of opportunities to build life skills like effective writing, public speaking, people and project management and leadership, all of which have been very useful in my career so far. My class- mates were confident and smart and added great value to my learning in the classroom. Because of the CS and Math skills I built at JSS, and the support of the faculty by way of strong recommendation letters, I got an admit to the Masters program in Computer Science at the State University of New York at Stony Brook. After finishing my Masters degree, I got a job at Microsoft Corp as a Software Development Engineer."
