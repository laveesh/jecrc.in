  		<p>SUHASINI is a social initiative taken by the students of JECRC to create awareness towards the education
of girl child in the society. SUHASINI was formed three years ago, with a motive to eradicate the menace
of female feticide. Students of SUHASINI visit various village and other backward sections of the society
and talk to people on a door to door basis. They also organize Nukkad Nataks and Workshops on
occasions like Womenâ€™s Day &amp; Girl Child Day to attract a larger audience towards their cause.</p>
