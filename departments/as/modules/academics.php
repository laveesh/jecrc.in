<p >Electronics and Communication Engineering department is the core department of the institute. The
Department has 50 highly qualified faculty members with Ph.D. and M.Tech from
prestigious institutions like IITs, NITs and other institutes of repute.
</p>
<p>
The Electronics and Communication Engineering Department is enriched with various laboratories.</p>
<p >The ECE Department practices the 'Outcome Based Education' (OBE) approach for teaching-learning process. This is a learning-centric approach rather than traditional teaching-centric approach to education. This approach focuses on the graduate attributes the students should possess after the completion of the programme through the following objectives :-</p>
<ul class="sectionList">
	<li >To provide students with the fundamentals of engineering sciences with more emphasis in electronics and communication engineering by way of analyzing and exploiting electronics engineering challenges.</li>
	<li >To train students with good scientific and electronics and communication engineering knowledge so as to comprehend, analyze, design, and create electronic based novel products and solutions for the real life problems.</li>
	<li >To inculcate professional and ethical attitude, effective communication skills, teamwork skills, multidisciplinary approach, entrepreneurial thinking and an ability to relate electronics and communication engineering with social issues.</li>
	<li >To provide students with an academic environment aware of excellence, leadership, written ethical codes and guidelines, and the self-motivated life-long learning needed for a successful electronics and communication engineering professional career.</li>
	<li >To prepare students to excel in electronics and communication based industry and higher education by educating students in electronics and communication engineering field along with high moral values and knowledge.</li>
</ul>
<p >Under OBE model, the quality of teaching is measured by the quality of learning, defined as outcomes, that takes place. Programme Educational Objectives (PEOs) are formulated to align with the vision and mission of the Department. Programme Outcomes (POs) are defined to achieve PEOs which are further aligned to Course Outcomes (CO) of each subject. Vision, Mission and PEOs are the long-term objectives whereas POs and COs are the short-term outcomes.</p>
