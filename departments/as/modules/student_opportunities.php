<p>The main goal of department is to make open doors for the undergraduates to understand their skill and
potential to advance the knowledge for the innovative and social devlpoement of the society and to reinforce the connection amongst the scholarly world and industry.
</p>
<p>
There is several opportunity in the market for Electronics and communication engineers. They
are jus lag behind in skills, aptitude and the training. The Entry Level package for the Freshers
starts with 2.5 to 3.5 lakh per annum. But the Brilliant students with their outstanding
knowledge in the Field of Embedded System, VLSI design and Communication technology can
go far beyond average package.
</p>
<p>
Electronics and Communication engineering is one of the most popular engineering branches out
there. Among the Indian engineering aspirants, this particular discipline has been a popular
choice for quite some time.With the evolution of the computer age, electronics communication
has transformed into a field that is inevitable, required by almost all the industries.
</p>
<p>
Electronics is now part of our everyday life, from the mobile phones to televisions, computers
and even the high-end advanced satellites that are helping us to lead a smooth life.Even
electronics and communication engineering is the major driving force for the present day
Information Technology revolution.
</p>
<p>
Electronics and Communication Engineering has also penetrated into other areas like healthcare,
instrumentation, automation, remote sensing, signal processing etc. So students pursuing
electronics and communication engineering have a lot of scope in varied industries.</p>
