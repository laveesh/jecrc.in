						An engineer’s life is quite challenging and enjoyable and my College gave me the knowledge and support with its splendid learning atmosphere as well as teaching facilities which are impeccable and the variety of services available made me always feel very lucky to be a part of it. Completing a bachelor degree is a small part of our life long journey. However, it is an essential part of our successful career. Therefore, I would say “It’s not the end, but just the beginning of our educational journey!” I would like to thank JECRC and our Electronics  department for all the enormous support and opportunities.

				Attending College for the first time has been a trying but great experience for me. The way in which I have grown up, mature, and found out who really I am, is something that I couldn’t accomplish without going to college. At This College I gained friendship and experiences which added a different perspective to my life. It feels great to be taught by amazing teachers who are the best. They always motivated and encouraged me to face the risks and learn new things. I am and will always be thankful to JECRC for making me a person I am today.

				I was fortunate to be placed in Ericsson where I was trained on hardware connectivity and Networking applications . During my tenure at Ericsson, I could put forth my technical skills which I have learnt at the JECRC Institution. It was a very wonderful experience to work in the corporate world. It happened because of the assistance and support provided by the JECRC foundation.
