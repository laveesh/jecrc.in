        <p>Jaipur Engineering College and Research Centre, Jaipur has implemented Outcome Based Education (OBE) in the Institute. JECRC is proud to mention that it has created necessary manpower and infrastructure to implement Outcome Based Education from the year 2014-15. So far the Technical Institutions have been imparting teaching through a traditional system where the learning outcomes of the students are not clearly measured. The ‘Washington Accord’ emphasize on outcome based education. There is a need to develop a standard approach to match quality assurance for Engineering Programs. The graduating Engineers of the future will need to be evaluated in their outlook and experience and be ready for global opportunities. So, there is a need and challenge for all Technical Institutions to aid and empower the future students for global environment.</p>

        <p>The Outcome Based Education focuses on outcomes through achievement of learning objectives of
          their program. The OBE strongly emphasize student centric learning and adaptation of modern
          teaching-learning systems. JECRC has gone far ahead in implementing OBE where every student
          will distinctly write-down the learning outcomes in every hour of lecture he/she attends. The
          Teachers have been given specialized training to embark on OBE method of delivery and use of
          modern teaching-learning systems. With this OBE, it is expected that the students distinctly gain
          excellent knowledge in their relevant branch and contribute to the development of the organizations
        where they are employed.</p>
